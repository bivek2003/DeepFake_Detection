# 💾 Storage-Efficient Deepfake Detection Development

## 🎯 Strategy for 260GB Storage Constraint

Instead of downloading massive datasets, we'll create a **demonstration-focused approach** that showcases your technical skills without requiring terabytes of data.

## 📊 Recommended Dataset Selection (Total: ~50GB)

### Priority 1: Essential Datasets (25GB)
```yaml
selected_datasets:
  wilddeepfake:
    size: "4.2 GB"
    reason: "Publicly available, no forms required"
    url: "https://huggingface.co/datasets/wilddeepfake"
    
  celebdf_subset:
    size: "5 GB" 
    reason: "Download subset of Celeb-DF (first 1000 videos)"
    url: "https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics"
    
  asvspoof2021_subset:
    size: "5 GB"
    reason: "Download evaluation set only"
    url: "https://zenodo.org/record/4837263"
    
  synthetic_generated:
    size: "10 GB"
    reason: "Generate synthetic data for development"
```

### Priority 2: If Space Available (25GB more)
```yaml
optional_datasets:
  faceforensics_compressed:
    size: "15 GB"
    reason: "Download compressed/low-quality version"
    
  custom_scraped:
    size: "10 GB" 
    reason: "Scrape YouTube videos + generate fakes"
```
